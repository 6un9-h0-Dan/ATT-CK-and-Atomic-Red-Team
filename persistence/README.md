持久化是指攻击者为了维持在该系统上持久存在而对做出系统的任何访问，操作或配置更改。 攻击者经常会面临访问权限的中断，例如系统重启，凭据丢失或其他问题，因此需要攻击者使用远程访问工具重新启动或替换后门才能重新获得访问权限。Persistence is any access, action, or configuration change to a system that gives an adversary a persistent presence on that system. Adversaries will often need to maintain access to systems through interruptions such as system restarts, loss of credentials, or other failures that would require a remote access tool to restart or alternate backdoor for them to regain access.
